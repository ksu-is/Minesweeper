# Minesweeper
This application will allow users to play a game known as "Minesweeper".

Each title revealed that does not contain a mine shows a number that correlates to the amount of mines that border the number tile. This gives the player an indication as to which tiles to click next to not reveal a mine and end the game.

Minesweeper is meant to be a game that people can pick up on very quickly and give minimal time commitment to.
